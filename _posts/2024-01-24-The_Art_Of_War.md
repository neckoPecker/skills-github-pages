> "The Art of War is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or ruin.
> Hence under no circumstances can it be neglected." â€” Sun Tzu


The Art of War rests on 5 constant factors which to take into account in one's deliberation to win the war. These are:
1. Moral Law
2. Heaven
3. Earth
4. The Commander
5. Method and Discipline

Sun Tzu says, with these 5 considerations, is he able to predict which army would win. Corresponding with the list set
out above, we can create some questions for each consideration (even though we generally want much more than one).
1. Which army has will heed the commander's words, no matter what grave danger or peril they face?
2. How will the army navigate through sun, rain, and snow? In the extremes of cold and heat?
3. How will the army naigate through the landscape? How do we use the hills and lows to our advantage over the opposition?
4. How does the Commander instill benevolence, virtue, and discipline among the army?
5. What methods are proven to ensure that the army is hardened against the opposition? How do we prepare them?
